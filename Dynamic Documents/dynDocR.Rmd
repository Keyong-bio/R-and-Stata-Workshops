# Introduction

In this workshop, I will demonstrate how to create a dynamic document in R. These documents are useful for integrating statistical code with narration that explains the executed code. By either clicking a button or typing a command, one can execute the code in an R Markdown file, reproducing one's work and exporting the results in a finished report. One can export a finished report in a variety of formats, including HTML, PDF, Microsoft Word, or rich text format documents; as well as HTML- or PDF-based slides, Notebooks, and more. I will demonstrate how to export the finished document as an HTML web page, a Word document, and a PDF document (requires LaTeX installation).

# Basic Example

The folowing example is included as part of an .Rmd file template.

## What is R Markdown?

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Real Examples

## Step #1: Set Working Directory

Before one begins any research project, they should always set their working directory. One can set the working directory in R via the `setwd(dir)` function.

```{r wd, eval=FALSE}
setwd(dir = "filepath")
```

Note that the `eval = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent execution of the R code specified in the R code chunk.

One of the nice features of a R markdown document is that when *kniting* this file, the working directory is set automatically to the location of the markdown file, thus making this step unnecessary.

## Step #2: Load Required Packages

The second step is loading any required packages. Here, I use a user-created function to check if my R installation includes the set of specified packages. If it does not, then R will install the package(s) along with any associated dependent packages. After
