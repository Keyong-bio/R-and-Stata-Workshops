# Introduction

In this workshop, I will demonstrate how to create a dynamic document in R. These documents are useful for integrating statistical code with narration that explains the executed code. By either clicking a button or typing a command, one can execute the code in an R Markdown file, reproducing one's work and exporting the results in a finished report. One can export a finished report in a variety of formats, including HTML, PDF, Microsoft Word, or rich text format documents; as well as HTML- or PDF-based slides, Notebooks, and more. I will demonstrate how to export the finished document as an HTML web page, a Word document, and a PDF document (requires LaTeX installation).

# Basic Example

The following example is included as part of an .Rmd file template.

## What is R Markdown?

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Real Examples

## Preliminary Steps

### Step #1: Set Working Directory

Before one begins any research project, they should always set their working directory. One can set the working directory in R via the `setwd(dir)` function.

```{r wd, eval=FALSE}
setwd(dir = "filepath")
```

Note that the `eval = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent execution of the R code specified in the R code chunk.

One of the nice features of a R markdown document is that when *kniting* this file, the working directory is set automatically to the location of the markdown file, thus making this step unnecessary.

### Step #2: Load Required Packages

The second step is loading any required packages. Here, I use a user-created function to check if my R installation includes the set of specified packages. If it does not, then R will install the package(s) along with any associated dependent packages. Below is the function in question.

```{r packageFunc}
ipak <- function(pkg){
        new.pkg <- pkg[!(pkg %in% installed.packages()[, "Package"])]
        if (length(new.pkg))
                install.packages(new.pkg, dependencies = TRUE)
        sapply(pkg, require, character.only = TRUE)
}
```

The code chunk below places the names of the packages I am planning to use in a character vector-type object. I then use this object as the parameter for the package-loading function.

```{r packageLoad, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, results='hide', warning=FALSE}
packages <- c("tidyverse",
              "rio",
              "margins")

ipak(packages)
```

If you do not see anything, it is because I specified the following parameters: `echo=FALSE`, `message=FALSE`, `results='hide'`, and `warning=FALSE`. The parameter `message=FALSE` prevents any messages generated from the code from appearing in the document. The parameter `results='hide'`prevents any output produced from the code to appear in the document. Finally, the parameter `warning=FALSE` prevents any warnings generated from the code from appearing in the document.
